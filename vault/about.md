I'm a retired psychology professor but still active computer nerd. I love to use and dissect software, in particular open-source software such as Blender, QGIS, ffmpeg, Exiftools and others.

This digital garden is my way of trying to stay on top of all that information and also a way of contributing to those lovely open-source projects.
